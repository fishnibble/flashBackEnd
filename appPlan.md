* Over all plan

A suit of apps that interact with each other:

- Flashcard app
- Chat app
- Blog app

* flashcard

users will beable to add in their own lang vocab to decks. each card will beable to have ex of the vocab. if the user is using the chat app they will beable to hilight text within the chat app and turn them into a flash card. 

would like to be able to import anki, quizlet, and memorize decks.
would like to be able to allow users to share cards in chat to beale to make sure their ex are right.
would like to have diffrent card layouts for grammar and vocab

* Chat app

User will beable to find somone who is native in their target lang. users can then chat with them if there is vocab they are new to users can the make a flash card and have it imported to the flash card app.

* Blog

users can make a post and people they are freinds with on the chatapp can make corections to their posts.
